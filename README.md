## Other stuff

### ROS USB
teacher quote:
> ROS needs Ubuntu or Debian linux and does not run well on virtual machines.

> If your computer is able to boot from USB storage device (most computers are)  then it's possible to use following 16GB image. This is bootable 16GB USB storage drive image of ROS Kinetic with preinstalled packages and simulators on top of Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial. Swap is turned off.
